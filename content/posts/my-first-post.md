Finally, decided to use Hugo for the personal blog as the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) seems to take a little bit to setup according my taste. Will use this as long it takes to get things working with **Gatsby**.  

### What is this blog about ?

I am going to use this to document my experiments with different technologies. This is something that was on my mind since quite sometime but couldn't do it for various reasons. But as someone said

> The time for action is now. It's never too late to do something. 

I don't have any feedback in place right now, comments or something of that sort. While i work on it, please send your feedback [@thisisgvrt](https://twitter.com/thisisgvrt).
