I am in California now 😍. I left my job with Electronic Arts last december, to pursue masters at San Franscisco State University. So, the last two months have been a bit chaotic with quitting the job, move to U.S but it is all over now 😄

So, **why masters now ?**

Over the last few years building services within Electronic Arts, I found myself getting interested in the intricacies of databases. I enjoyed reading the challenges, tradeoffs the teams that build databases make and felt like this is some area that I will have some fun 🤪

While I dig myself a deeper into the rabbithole of the databases, I hope to find some free time to pursue my other ideas now 🤞
