**Project Psyche**

This is my shot at writing some of the services i need, They are currently solved by some services already out there. But not quite the way I expect them to be, and sometimes frustrating to work with. Since I love building stuff, why not build my own. These are the services I have in mind right now, probably new things might come later.

- **Reader**
  - Reader for articles, tweets, videos, read it later articles.
  - Chronlogically placed 🙃 , Finally !!
  - Can have a library section too, saved if marked post ```"some"``` duration ? 
- **Stream**
  - Stream of subscriptions 
      - twitter 
      - fb
      - instagram
      - email ?
      - read it later can also be treated as subscription 😉
      - trends (news) ?
      - weather stuff - is it going to rain today ☔️
- **Store**
  - Redundant storage supporting multiple storage backends. **Encryption** ?
      - iCloud
      - gCloud
      - self-hosted -> local raspi backed by some sort of dynamic DNS ?
- **Calendar**
  - Aims to be a ```"life manager"```, features include:
      - Static events, like birthdays and festivals.
      - dynamic events, like scheduling a dentist checkup.
      - recurring events, change water filter every 10 days.
      - location based events, pickup watch when you leave home ? 
      - parse emails ? - way, way later in future 😝
- **Hey**
  - Notification system, Ideally should figure out a way to alert me.
      - Should support multiple devices that i can use.
      - Detect the device that's best suited according to context & Location ?
- **Logger**
  - Targetted at [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/)
      - Pull from strava.
      - Food logger 🍱 
      - Parse sms and purchases ? Or **Cred** ??
      - NFC, GPS, WiFi tracking - location history - simpler strava 😇 ?
      - Emotions tracking 🎭 - through a Dairy/Log
      - Sleep tracking 🛌
      - App tracking (Mobile as well as a computer)
