I took a break from this blog and any side projects for some time now.
I was on a vacation from Dec 14 till Jan 7. During this vacation, I had the chance to visit Texas & California. I had some well deserved & required time off from chaos that is my life in hyderabad. It gave me some time to think over some priorities in my life.

After I came back, had a very hectic month at work due to some commited releases. Thankfully, its all done now and I can get back to what I love doing, building stuff ðŸ”§

During my vacation, I had some thoughts regarding [Project Psyche](/posts/project-psyche/). I realised that, I was looking at from a backend & an engineer perspective - So, I thought it was just a collection of services. But what i realised what they were, an eco-system of products ðŸ’¡

> **Eco system** - group of devices with software to create one collaborative network.
> <cite>[Apple magazine][1]</cite>

This seemingly simple revelation is very important in taking decisions about priorites and features. I am glad to have realised that sooner.
