Over some time, I have been trying to get better at various things. Most of them haven't materialized (yet ðŸ™ˆ). This is probably due to my [laid-back](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/laid-back) attitude on most of the things, I find it easier to deal with stress this way. 

But I want to experiment a different way for couple of months (or more). I have certain goals in mind for this year & should tick them off.

As a single guy, living alone - one thing that's hard is to understand when to stop. My current lifestyle allows me to immerse myself with work 18 hours a day with little to nothing of a negative feedback. Also, as a eternal procastinator -> It's easier for me to get lost in the work at office and leave everything else on back-burner. 

To work on this, I went on streak of self improvement books, blogs & many more. While there a billion things, that were told. One thing that caught my eye is 

> Design your environment to make success easier.

While, this does seem pretty silly and obvious. I believe this is something that could be done easily, in small incremental steps while adding a considerable impact in the long run. 

At my work at EA where we monitor game servers for issues, we call certain signals [KPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicatorhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator)s **K**ey **P**erformance **I**ndicators. I believe the same can be applied to a healthy balanced living.

Infact, the same sort of thing is applied in our health checkups. Doctors worldwide have a fixed set of signals from a human body that can be examined and compared against a set of thresholds to diagnose an issue/disorder.

While going over this topic with a friend of mine, realised it's something quite a number of people already are doing - [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/get-started/)

I believe pairing this quantified self thing into a feedback loop is a nice step going forward.
